Hi, I would have liked to have got further with this, but there's actually a fair bit to it.

The styling isn't complete, so you can't really tell how close you got to completion.

As it stands, you can only lose, it never tells you when you've won.

It can be a bit when clearing areas, depending on how big the area is, and its shape. 

Points:
 1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
 1. Used the canonical React tutorial as a starting point. https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html
 1. Uses github as a backup
 1. Don't use anchor with href="#', convert to button
 1. Uses underscores to indicate privacy, just by convention
 1. Didn't have a file per class, as is usually the case
 1. Uses brute force for sending messages to surrounding squares
 1. Uses eslint
 
Illustrates:
 1. Use of apply and bind, where appropriate
 1. Use of state and props, hopefully correctly
 1. Uses google font, roboto
 1. Uses react refs
 1. Use of js apply and bind
 1. Uses lodash (once)
 
TODO:
 1. Use jscs
 1. Add some data feed
 1. Add cool animations, similar to what was in the original minesweeper
 1. How do I know I've finished?
