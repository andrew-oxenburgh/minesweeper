Points:
 1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
 1. Used the canonical React tutorial as a starting point. https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html
 1. Uses github as a backup
 1. Don't use anchor with href="#', convert to button
 1. Uses underscores to indicate privacy, just by convention
 1. Didn't break up by class, as is normal
 
Illustrates:
 1. Use of apply and bind, where appropriate
 1. Use of state and props, hopefully correctly
 
TODO:
 1. Use jscs
 1. Add some data feed
 1. Add cool animations, similar to what was in the original minesweeper
